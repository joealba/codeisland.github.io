<p>
  Code Island is the official Rhode Island “brigade” of Code for America, a national organization of people working to help residents and governments harness technology to solve problems. We meet roughly twice per month, and our <a title="Join us!" href="http://www.meetup.com/Rhode-Island-Code-for-America-Brigade/">meet-ups</a> are open to anybody who wants to help.
</p>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
  Code Island members seek to use our collective knowledge and experience to transform open government data into real solutions for problems facing our fellow Rhode Islanders and, potentially, people across the country and around the world. As with all Code for America brigades, any tools we create will be available to other brigades and anyone anywhere that wants to adapt them to their own specific circumstances.

<h2>Code for America’s Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>
  Code for America is dedicated to providing a safe space for collaboration.
